Their importance will be shown when discovering many other theorems through the idea of a Riemann sum. In this article, we will explain the reason behind the mathematical notation of an integral, along with a new way to approximate and define the integral.</p><p>Let's begin with the notation of an indefinite integral:</p>\\\\[\\\\int f(x) \\\\, dx\\\\]<p>Interestingly, the \u201cintegral\u201d in the beginning is actually a smooth-looking \u201cs\u201d (standing for sum) and the \u201cdx\u201d is multiplied by said sum. This is because of the alternate definition of the integral, which we're about to see.</p><p>Let's begin with our favorite random <strong>f(x)</strong> curve:</p><img src='/imgs/Calculus/1_1.png' alt='A random curve representing the function f(x).'><p>Our goal is to essentially find an \u201capproximation\u201d for this integral, then to make it exact later. Using the \u201cantiderivative\u201d method sometimes is impossible, so an approximation may be required. As we see, we are looking at the area for <strong>f(x)</strong> between <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>. We do not know how to find the area of this shape. But we do know how to take an area of a rectangle! Let's do a couple of \u201cslices\u201d between <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> for now to get an idea of what this looks like:</p><img src='/imgs/Calculus/1_2.png' alt='The graph of f(x) with arbitrary rectangles approximating the area under the curve.'><p>As we see, an approximation of rectangles at certain points across the <strong>f(x)</strong> curve can provide a good approximation of the area of <strong>f(x)</strong> between <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>. Let's make this general, though.</p><p>At each \u201cslice\u201d across the interval <strong>f(x)</strong>, let's try to define them successively for <strong>k</strong> amounts of slices: <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong>, <strong>x<sub>2</sub></strong> , etc. <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong> starts right after <strong>a</strong>, so the <strong>x</strong> slice right before <strong>b</strong> would be called <strong>x<sub>k-1</sub></strong>. Now, it may be important to know the length of one of these intervals, so we can calculate the area of one of these rectangles. Well, the distance between each rectangle would be <strong>x<sub>k</sub> - x<sub>k-1</sub></strong>. Truthfully, we can just call that <strong>\u0394x</strong>, as it is simply just the change across the x-axis. Now, we don't know how many rectangles we want, so let's just call the amount <strong>n</strong>. We want each rectangle to be the same length for ease of calculation, so the formula for <strong>\u0394x</strong> is intuitive.</p>\\\\[\\\\Delta x = \\\\frac{b - a}{n}\\\\]<p>(where <strong>n</strong> is the amount of rectangles across <strong>[a, b]</strong>)</p><p>Well, that's interesting. We have an idea for <strong>\u0394x</strong>, but what about the height of each rectangle? The truth is, since this is just an approximation, we need the height to be some <strong>f(c)</strong> where <strong>c</strong> is between two successive intervals, <strong>x<sub>k-1</sub></strong> to <strong>x<sub>k</sub></strong>. <strong>c</strong> just has to be some random point between this as to get an idea for a height, so we can call this <strong>C<sub>k</sub></strong>. This indicates a random x-value across the interval.</p><p>So now we can build a formula for one rectangle:</p>\\\\[A = lw\\\\]\\\\[A_{\\\\text{rect}} = f(C_k) \\\\Delta x\\\\]<p>Interesting\u2026 <strong>C<sub>k</sub></strong> is arbitrary however, so it may be annoying to randomly pick a point between two consecutive slices if we are attempting to approximate. There are three common ways we choose an arbitrary point.</p><p>1. The first method is the simplest. We can just choose the leftmost point between 2 slices (the left slice, so <strong>a</strong> would be the first slice). <strong>C<sub>k</sub></strong> would equal <strong>a</strong> added with increments of <strong>\u0394x</strong>.</p>\\\\[C_k = a + \\\\Delta x(k - 1)\\\\]<p>Why the <strong>k-1</strong>? Remember, since this is the leftmost point, we need to start AT <strong>a</strong>, and <strong>k</strong> starts at <strong>1</strong>, so we need to subtract by <strong>1</strong> as to not start on the right.</p><p>2. Also simple: just the rightmost point.</p>\\\\[C_k = a + \\\\Delta x(k)\\\\]<p>3: This one is less commonly used, as it's only beneficial depending on what you are approximating, as we will see. Relatively derivative in explanation from (1) and (2):</p>\\\\[C_k = a + \\\\Delta x(k - \\\\frac{1}{2})\\\\]<p>The truth is, each of these equations are nice to approximate for one rectangle. But we need all of these summed up! Well, pretty simple solution, use a summation!</p>\\\\[A_{approx} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(C_k)\\\\Delta x\\\\]<p>That's nice, but it is still \u201cjust an approximation.\u201d To make this infinitely accurate, we would have to make smaller and smaller rectangles, so as to not overestimate or underestimate. Well, good thing we know what a limit is! If the number of rectangles <strong>n</strong> approaches infinity, the accuracy of the area should approach infinity.</p>\\\\[A = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(C_k)\\\\Delta x\\\\]<p>That technically is an expression for the exact area under an interval, which would be equal to some definite integral.</p>\\\\[\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(C_k)\\\\Delta x = \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx\\\\]<p>Wait a minute: that notation is starting to make sense! The \u201cs\u201d looking thing is actually a summation, but just with a limit to the sum! Now, notice how <strong>\u0394x</strong> is essentially a constant in terms of the summation, which is in terms of <strong>k</strong>. This means you can take out <strong>\u0394x</strong> from the summation, looking something like this:</p>\\\\[\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} [f(C_k)]\\\\Delta x\\\\]<p>The summation does not deal with <strong>\u0394x</strong>, which is why in the integral notation, you multiply it by a tiny bit <strong>dx</strong>. It's the same exact thing as that <strong>\u0394x</strong> term! Now, why did that <strong>f(C<sub>k</sub>)</strong> turn into <strong>f(x)</strong>? <strong>C<sub>k</sub></strong> is the arbitrary point within a rectangle. But if these two slices are essentially becoming closer and closer, with <strong>n \u2192 \u221e</strong>, then the random point <strong>C<sub>k</sub></strong> just becomes <strong>x</strong>.</p><p>What are the uses of these four relationships when dealing with exact values? Although almost always unnecessary when finding exact values with a Riemann sum, they can be used to calculate exactly. The best demonstration is with an example.</p>\\\\[\\\\Delta x = \\\\frac{b-a}{n}\\\\]\\\\[C_k = a + \\\\Delta x(k - 1)\\\\]\\\\[C_k = a + \\\\Delta x(k - \\\\frac{1}{2})\\\\]\\\\[C_k = a + \\\\Delta x(k)\\\\]<p>Let's say we want to find the area under <strong>x<sup>2</sup></strong> in <strong>[0, 1]</strong> using the Riemann sum. Notice how we can choose how to estimate our <strong>C<sub>k</sub></strong>. Let's choose the rightmost approximation.</p><p>First, lets calculate <strong>\u0394x</strong>. </p>\\\\[\\\\Delta x = \\\\frac{b - a}{n}\\\\]\\\\[\\\\Delta x = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\]<p>Notice how we can calculate an actual value for <strong>\u0394x</strong>, this is because we are trying to EXACTLY find the value, no estimation.</p>\\\\[C_k = a + \\\\Delta x(k)\\\\]\\\\[C_k = \\\\Delta x(k)\\\\]<p>Substituting in for <strong>\u0394x</strong>:</p>\\\\[C_k = \\\\frac{k}{n}\\\\]<p>Now we can deal with the entire thing!</p>\\\\[\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(C_k)\\\\Delta x\\\\]\\\\[\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(\\\\frac{k}{n})(\\\\frac{1}{n})\\\\]<p>What is <strong>f(k / n)</strong>? Well <strong>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup></strong>, so just use the function!</p>\\\\[\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (\\\\frac{k}{n})^2(\\\\frac{k}{n})\\\\]\\\\[\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\frac{k^2}{n^3}\\\\]<p><strong>1 / n<sup>3</sup></strong> is constant to the summation, so we can remove it.</p>\\\\[\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n^3} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} (k^2)\\\\]<p>Using the formula for the sum of <strong>k<sup>2</sup></strong>:</p>\\\\[\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6n}\\\\]<p>This is just a limit; let's solve it.</p>\\\\[\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{2n^2+3n+1}{6n}\\\\]<p>This just simplifies out to <strong>1/3</strong>, using our rules for solving limits!</p><p>As we see, this is WAY too time consuming, which is why it is seldom used in practice.

Interestingly, the 'first part' was proved secondly, and the 'second part' was proved first. However, it makes much more sense for any calculus student to learn the first part's proof, then the second one, despite the order that they were proven. So let's jump right into the first part!</p><p>The first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus connects the idea of a <strong>derivative</strong> and an <strong>integral</strong>. It states that the <strong>derivative</strong> of an <strong>integral</strong> returns the original function. In mathematical notation: \\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[\\\\int f(x) \\\\, dx\\\\right] = f(x)\\\\]This can also be used to say that the <strong>integral</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong> (area under the curve) is just the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong>, or in simpler terms, a function <strong>g(x)</strong> where it's derivative of <strong>f(x)</strong>. As we can see, proving this theorem will give us a gateway into actually solving <strong>integrals</strong>, one of the hardest tasks in calculus.</p><p>But why would we even consider a relationship in the first place? Well, let's consider a very general function, <strong>f(x)</strong>.</p><img src='/imgs/Proofs/3_1.png' alt='Graph showing the area under the curve f(x) from red vertical line a to blue vertical line x, creating bounds representing the area function, A(x).'><p>Observe <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>A(x)</strong>, where <strong>A(x)</strong> is the area function. Basically, we are assuming that the area under any curve can be considered some function of <strong>x</strong>. As we see with the blue line to the right, changing that also changes the overall area of the function. If <strong>f(x)</strong> is decreasing, then the added area to <strong>A(x)</strong> will become less and less large. Here, we can intuitively see a connection to the <strong>derivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>A(x)</strong>. It just so happens that the area function IS the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong>, which is less intuitive to see.</p><p>Lets begin with the proof:</p><p>Consider <strong>A(x)</strong> and <strong>f(x)</strong> where <strong>A(x)</strong> is the area function to <strong>f(x)</strong>. We are to prove that <strong>A'(x) = f(x)</strong>.</p><p>Let's begin with the definition of a <strong>derivative</strong>, just to see if we can work with that somehow: \\\\[ A'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Notice <strong>A(x + h)</strong> and <strong>A(x)</strong>. These appear to be the difference of two areas. Let's represent this graphically.</p><img src='/imgs/Proofs/3_2.png' alt='Graph showing the area under the curve f(x), with bounds at x and x + h marking the area of A(x + h) - A(x).'><p>As we see, <strong>A(x + h) - A(x)</strong> must be some definite area, but what? Here, we will use interesting logic in our proof. The first thing we notice is that the value of <strong>f(x)</strong> at point <strong>x</strong> shown is at a minimum, and <strong>f(x+h)</strong> is at a maximum for the interval <strong>x</strong> to <strong>x + h</strong>. That seems unique, why isn't <strong>x + h</strong> moved a bit more to the right, where it wouldn't be a maximum of the interval? Well, the key is that the expression <strong>A(x + h) - A(x)</strong> is a limit, so <strong>h</strong> is meant to be a slight nudge to <strong>x</strong>. It seems a lot more like a nudge on the graph to show the idea of the area under a curve. Since <strong>h</strong> approaches <strong>0</strong>, it is meant to be a \u201csufficiently small\u201d value. This means that either <strong>f(x)</strong> or <strong>f(x + h)</strong> is a max or a min, depending if the function is increasing or not, because the distance between <strong>x</strong> and <strong>x + h</strong> will approach <strong>0</strong>. Although it doesn't really matter as we will see, the function is increasing so <strong>f(x + h)</strong> will be the max. and <strong>f(x)</strong> will be the min.</p><p>Now with that settled, why does that even matter? Well, we know the area between <strong>x</strong> and <strong>x + h</strong> is an area, and that <strong>f(x)</strong> is the lowest point on the graph, and <strong>f(x + h)</strong> is the highest. Now, we know that the area in the interval is some area value, <strong>A</strong>. Let's simplify the area for <strong>A</strong> greatly. Let's say that the area for <strong>A</strong> is just the area of some rectangle with the width of the interval <strong>h</strong>. Then, <strong>A = h * f(c)</strong>, where <strong>f(c)</strong> is some height between <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>f(x + h)</strong>. Ok\u2026 but how does that help us? Well, we know that <strong>f(x)</strong> is a minimum, so <strong>f(x) * h</strong> MUST be smaller than the actual area for the interval, because all other points on the graph are greater than <strong>f(x)</strong>. So, if you view the interval as the sum of a bunch of rectangles, we just took the smallest rectangle and spread it across the interval, meaning it must be smaller. With similar logic, since <strong>f(x + h)</strong> is a maximum, it MUST be larger than the actual area. With that, we know that <strong>f(c)</strong> must be somewhere between <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>f(x + h)</strong>. Since our function is continuous, we know that every value must exist between <strong>f(x)</strong> and <strong>f(x + h)</strong>, which means every value must exist between <strong>f(x) * h</strong> and <strong>f(x + h) * h</strong>. This means that area <strong>A</strong> must exist in the form <strong>f(c) * h</strong>, where <strong>c \u2208 [x, x + h]</strong>. \\\\[ A'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Back to the actual math, we've essentially just logically proven that <strong>A(x + h) - A(x) = f(c) * h</strong>. Let's substitute that in! \\\\[ A'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{f(c) * h}{h} \\\\right] \\\\] \\\\[ A'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\left[ f(c) \\\\right] \\\\]</p><p>Now, we know that <strong>c \u2208 [x, x + h]</strong> then, \\\\[ x \\\\leq c \\\\leq x + h \\\\]</p><p>But, <strong>h\u21920</strong>, so: \\\\[ x \\\\leq c \\\\leq x \\\\]</p><p>Which means <strong>c = x</strong>, meaning <strong>f(c) = f(x)</strong>, solving the limit.</p><p><strong>A'(x) = f(x)</strong>, which is what we intended to prove.</p>\"]},\"proof-of-the-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-part-ii\":{\"title\":\"Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part II\",\"sections\":[\"<h1>Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part II</h1><i>Alexander De Carlo</i><p>There is a problem with the first part of our theorem. But\u2026 didn't we just prove it true? We did, but not to where we can do anything meaningful. What do we mean by this?</p><p>Note that we just proved <strong>A'(x) = f(x)</strong>, meaning the <strong>derivative</strong> of the area function of a graph is <strong>f(x)</strong>. But what precisely is the area function? Where does it begin, and where does it conclude? How can it be effectively expressed? The graph used in proving the first part of our fundamental theorem was convenient because it had a definite starting point. However, most graphs do not. Fortunately, we can choose the starting point of a graph without a clear beginning to be anywhere. But what implications does this have for our area function?</p><p>To answer this, let's consider the <strong>derivative</strong> of <strong>x<sup>2</sup></strong>:</p>\\\\[ \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[ x^2 \\\\right] = 2x \\\\]<p>Cool! What about <strong>x<sup>2</sup> + 1</strong>?</p>\\\\[ \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[ x^2 + 1 \\\\right] = 2x \\\\]<p><strong>x<sup>2</sup> + C</strong>?</p>\\\\[ \\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[ x^2 + C \\\\right] = 2x \\\\]<p>As we see, many things can share a <strong>derivative</strong>. Since the <strong>derivative</strong> of a constant is always <strong>0</strong>, the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of a function always has \\\"<strong>+ C</strong>\\\" after it, indicating that the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of a function is actually a family of functions that all differ from a constant value.</p><p>So, if <strong>A(x)</strong> is just the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong>, which we had just proven, then <strong>A(x) = F(x) + C</strong>. <strong>F(x)</strong> is just denoting the <strong>antiderivative</strong> function for <strong>A(x)</strong>. It actually makes sense why a <strong>C</strong> needs to be there for such a general area function.</p><img src='/imgs/Proofs/4_1.png' alt='The graph shows a function f(x) and two points E and D on the x-axis with the corresponding vertical lines to the curve. The difference between the two x-coordinates is called h.'><p>Whether we start our area function at <strong>D</strong> or <strong>E</strong>, all the areas to the left of both <strong>D</strong> and <strong>E</strong> are the same. This means the area functions for both SHOULD be the same, just differing by some constant, <strong>C</strong>. This is called the <strong>indefinite integral</strong>.</p>\\\\[ \\\\int f(x) \\\\, dx = F(x) + C \\\\]<p>The explanation for the notation will be shown in a different article. Here, we are essentially finding an area function for <strong>f(x)</strong>, but we have no bounds on that function. The changing of bounds will just differ by a constant <strong>C</strong>, shown above.</p><p>We want to know how to evaluate <strong>integrals</strong> WITH bounds, however. The good thing is, we already know it should really include the area function. Let's say we start our <strong>integral</strong> at defined point <strong>a</strong>, and it goes to some variable point <strong>x</strong>.</p>\\\\[ A(x) = \\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\]<p>The variable <strong>t</strong> here is a dummy variable, because we are trying to show that <strong>x</strong> could be any point on the graph <strong>f(t)</strong>, which originally would be called <strong>f(x)</strong>. The <strong>\\\"x\\\"-axis</strong> would be called the <strong>\\\"t\\\"-axis</strong> to make things clearer. Essentially it's just changing the name of variables so as to not get the <strong>x</strong> in <strong>f(x)</strong> confused with the <strong>x</strong> on the <strong>integral</strong>.</p><p>We know that <strong>A(x)</strong> is the <strong>antiderivative</strong> of <strong>f(x)</strong>, so <strong>A(x) = F(x) + C</strong>. Thus:</p>\\\\[ F(x) + C = \\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\]<p>The important thing to note here is that we defined one boundary for the <strong>integral</strong>, at <strong>A</strong>. this means that we should be able to somehow solve for <strong>C</strong>, as <strong>C</strong> can no longer be just any constant. This <strong>integral</strong> with one bound at <strong>A</strong> should no longer be a family of <strong>antiderivatives</strong>, but just one specific <strong>antiderivative</strong>. But how can we solve it?  Well, we can do a sneaky trick. Let's make <strong>x</strong> some defined point <strong>B</strong>, essentially finding the area of some interval.</p><p>Then:</p>\\\\[ C = \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(t) \\\\, dt - F(b) \\\\]<p>That didn't really help us. But since we start at <strong>A</strong>, <strong>C</strong> must be the same, for any other arbitrary endpoint we pick. Then, how can we get rid of the nasty <strong>integral</strong>? Let's just make <strong>b = a</strong>! It's sneaky, but <strong>x</strong> can technically just be <strong>a</strong>. Now, an <strong>integral</strong> from <strong>a</strong> to <strong>a</strong> is just clearly <strong>0</strong>, because there is no area. Thus, <strong>C = -F(a)</strong>. Now, we've essentially discovered the second part of the fundamental theorem of calculus.</p>\\\\[ \\\\begin{array}{l} F(x) + C = \\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\\\\\ C = -F(a) \\\\end{array} \\\\]<p>Therefore:</p>\\\\[ F(x) - F(a) = \\\\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\]<p>We are pretty much done here, but the proof is shown for an interval between defined point <strong>A</strong> to defined point <strong>B</strong>, so we can just let <strong>x = a</strong>. This also allows us to not have to use the dummy variable <strong>t</strong> anymore and just make that <strong>x</strong>.</p>\\\\[ \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\\\, dx = F(b) - F(a) \\\\]<p>Simple, yet impactful. Basically, it doesn't matter at all what happens between <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, the value for the <strong>integral</strong> on an interval is just <strong>F(b) - F(a)</strong>.</p>\"]},\"disk-and-washers-formula\":{\"title\":\"Proof of the Disk and Washers Formula\",\"sections\":[\"<h1>Proof of the Disk and Washers Formula</h1><i>Alexander De Carlo</i><p>We know that integrals are used to find the area under a curve, but can we extend this to find the volume of a 3D object? The method should be pretty simple, as we can approach this in a similar way to Riemann sums. This time, however, we will consider 3D slices.</p><p>We know that the general volume for some 3D object is <strong>V = CA * W</strong>, the cross-sectional area of a shape multiplied by the width, or the 3rd dimensional component.</p><img src='/imgs/Calculus/4_1.png' alt='A diagram of a 3D cone created by rotating a triangle around the x-axis.'><p>Let's study this cone as an example of a 3D object. The cone is oriented on the x-axis, which aligns with our Riemann sum taking method we want to increment across some <strong>\u0394x</strong>. Now let's look at some slices on this cone. We see that the shape of any vertical cross-section is a circle, but that isn't true for all 3D objects. So, let's just call this general cross-sectional area <strong>A(x)</strong>. <strong>A(x)</strong> is a function as it should change its value depending on <strong>x</strong> (in the cone's case, the circle grows with a larger <strong>x</strong>). This means that a volume <strong>V</strong> for some singular slice is:</p>\\\\[V_{section} = A(C_k)\\\\Delta x\\\\]<p>What's up with the <strong>C<sub>k</sub></strong>? It's the same idea with Riemann sums. The <strong>C<sub>k</sub></strong> is an arbitrary point between two slices. It would be redundant to show that fact once again.</p><p>This looks remarkably similar to how we did Riemann sums, with 1 extra step. Now we don't need to use some <strong>f(x)</strong>, as we are dealing with a cross-sectional area function!</p><p>Adding in our summation to sum across all slices:</p>\\\\[V_{approx} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n A(C_k)\\\\Delta x\\\\]<p>Then, making our slices go to infinity:</p>\\\\[V = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} [\\\\sum_{k=1}^n A(C_k)]\\\\Delta x\\\\]<p>This is the EXACT same structure as a Riemann sum. So, we can say that the area for any solid is just:</p>\\\\[V = \\\\int_a^b A(x)dx\\\\]<p>We managed to turn a large problem into a simpler one, but this equation isn't as useful as we need it to be.

It's a circle! What is the area of a circle? <strong>A = \u03c0r<sup>2</sup></strong>! But, what is <strong>r</strong>? Unfortunately, <strong>r</strong> is variable across the shape. But, since we are oriented right across the x-axis, <strong>r</strong> is just <strong>f(x)</strong>! <strong>r</strong> represents the y-value at any point <strong>x</strong>, which is half the length of the circular 3D cross-section! A more specific formula now becomes clear:</p>\\\\[V = \\\\int_a^b A(x)dx\\\\] \\\\[V = \\\\int_a^b \\\\pi f(x)^2 dx\\\\] \\\\[V = \\\\pi \\\\int_a^b f(x)^2 dx\\\\]<p>This is the disk and washers formula, used for any solid of revolution. Why the name, though? Well, a disk is one of the circular slices, and a washer is basically a circular slice, but with a circular hole carving out its center. The next part of this theorem deals with the volume of a  solid with some part missing in the middle, akin to a bead.</p><p>A washer's area would be the area of the surrounding circle subtracted by the area of an inner circle.

Why would we need another? Well, it really comes down to the situations where using the Disk and Washers method may be challenging. Let's look at an example function, and let's make it challenging:</p><img src='/imgs/Calculus/6_1.png' alt='The graph of y = 3(x - 0.5)^2 + (x - 0.5)^5 on [0, 1.5].'><p><strong>y = 3(x-.5)<sup>2</sup> + (x - 0.5)<sup>5</sup></strong> on <strong>[0, 1.5]</strong>.</p><p>Now, rotating this around the x-axis shouldn't be a problem for disks and washers, as we are in terms of <strong>x</strong>. What if we want to rotate around the y-axis, though? Those solids would look completely different, along with the fact that it would be extremely hard to solve for <strong>y</strong>, and multiple functions would certainly be involved. There must be a better way. Preferably, a way where we can rotate around the y-axis and be solved in terms of <strong>x</strong>, and vice versa. That's where cylindrical shells come into play.</p><p>The idea is that we want to try to rotate some function around the y-axis when such a function is solved for <strong>y</strong>. In this case, if we rotate around the y-axis, a thought is to maybe build it out of a bunch of \u201crings\u201d of cylinders.</p><img src='/imgs/Calculus/6_1.png' alt='A diagram of the area under f(x) spun around the y-axis to create a 3D solid of revolution.'><p>\u201cRings\u201d or cylinders with some very small width all added together can build the entire function. As we deal with solids of revolution, we will always have slices that are circular. Doing it this way, the cylinders added together will find the area of a function revolving around the y-axis, even when the equation you use is in terms of <strong>x</strong>. This is because the cylinders lie upright to find the area, or parallel to the function, and in disks and washers, the slices were found perpendicularly to the function. So, how do we find the area of one of those rings? Well, lets just assume we have one cylinder with a hole in it:</p>\\\\[V = \\\\pi r_1^2h - \\\\pi r_2^2h\\\\]<p>(Where <strong>r<sub>1</sub></strong> is outer and <strong>r<sub>2</sub></strong> is the missing inner.)</p>\\\\[V = \\\\pi h(r_1^2 - r_2^2)\\\\]<p>What exactly is our goal? We know we need to get an equation for the volume in such a way where we can easily sum them all together and take a limit of the amount of cylinders to infinity. This means that we eventually need to say the thickness of these rings approaches <strong>0</strong>! Then it would be nice to get this equation somehow in terms of the thickness of the ring, or shell. What is the thickness? It should mathematically be represented as <strong>(r<sub>1</sub> - r<sub>2</sub>)</strong>. Then, let's take a difference of squares.</p>\\\\[V = \\\\pi h(r_1 + r_2)(r_1 - r_2)\\\\]<p>There we can see the thickness. There's one more problem though. If we are to build this formula in a similar way to Riemann sums, we need an arbitrary point somewhere within the thickness of the cylindrical shell. We already obtained <strong>(r<sub>1</sub> - r<sub>2</sub>)</strong>, so it would be wise to not alter it. However, <strong>(r<sub>1</sub> + r<sub>2</sub>)</strong> interests us. This is almost the formula for a midpoint between the <strong>2 radii</strong>. That would be perfect for some arbitrary point! But, we need this to be divided by <strong>2</strong>. Not to worry, we can just multiply by 2 somewhere else in the equation.</p>\\\\[V = 2\\\\pi * h * \\\\frac{(r_1+r_2)}{2}(r_1 - r_2)\\\\]<p>Although it doesn't appear so, we are almost done. This equation we created basically says:</p><p><strong>Volume = constant * height * midpoint between 2 shells * thickness of shells</strong>.</p><p>Well, our thickness of our shells, <strong>(r<sub>1</sub> - r<sub>2</sub>)</strong> is awfully similar to <strong>\u0394x</strong>. Why? If we imagine one shell at some point <strong>x<sub>k</sub></strong> , and the other point at <strong>x<sub>k-1</sub></strong>, then the \u201cthickness\u201d between the two, is the same as <strong>x<sub>k-1</sub> - x<sub>k</sub></strong>, which is the definition of <strong>\u0394x</strong>.</p>\\\\[V = 2\\\\pi * h * \\\\frac{(r_1+r_2)}{2} * \\\\Delta x\\\\]<p>What about <strong>(r<sub>1</sub> + r<sub>2</sub>) / 2</strong>?

Since we need to factor out a common <strong>h</strong> from the top, and the <strong>nx<sup>n - 1</sup></strong> term only has one <strong>h</strong>, it's clear that we don't need to see what the rest of the coefficients are.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} [nx^{n-1} + C_3x^{n-2}h ... + h^{n-1}]\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = [nx^{n-1} + 0... + 0]\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}\\\\]<p>Proven! Except, when we introduced the idea of using the binomial theorem, we forgot to say that this restricts the entire proof to only non-negative integers\u2026 Not a problem, however. We just need to find a way to expand this to the negatives, and then find a way to expand this to all rationals. Now, there's an easy way to expand this to the negatives. Let's take what we've proven:</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[x^n]\\\\]<p>Now, let's hitch a negative.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[x^{-n}]\\\\]<p>This should represent all negative and only non positive integers. Good thing we have exponent rules, as we can tie this back to our earlier proof.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[\\\\frac{1}{x^n}]\\\\] \\\\[n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+\\\\]<p>We should be able to use the quotient rule to solve the problem.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[\\\\frac{1}{x^2}] = \\\\frac{x^2 \\\\cdot 0 - 1 \\\\cdot 2x^1}{[x^2]^2}\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[\\\\frac{1}{x^2}] = \\\\frac{-nx^{n-1}}{x^{2n}}\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[\\\\frac{1}{x^n}] = -nx^{-n-1}\\\\]<p>If <strong>n</strong> is restricted to all non negative integers, then <strong>-n</strong> is restricted to all non positive integers. If we let <strong>m</strong> to be <strong>-n</strong>, then:</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[x^m] = mx^{m-1}\\\\] \\\\[m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\]<p>If we have these two equations that are simultaneously true, then expanding <strong>n</strong> to be under all integers would create a piecewise function where the function is the same across negative and positive integers. Essentially the piecewise function would be redundant, and you'd finally end up with:</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}\\\\] \\\\[n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\]<p>All that work to just extend the same equation to the integers. Lets try to extend this to rationals, which is trickier. The rationals can be written in the form <strong>m * n</strong> where <strong>n</strong> and <strong>m</strong> are integers and <strong>n</strong> is not <strong>0</strong>, so this should find its way in our proof. Let's start with some general equation, as our approach is not fully fleshed out, yet.</p>\\\\[y = x^{\\\\frac{m}{n}}\\\\]<p>Since we have the formula working for integers, we need to get this equation rearranged to where we can apply it. The reason having the equation here is helpful is because there are no good identities we can use for this expression, so we may have to resort to implicit differentiation.  We can then take each side to the power of <strong>n</strong>.</p>\\\\[y^n = x^m\\\\]<p>This is a perfect candidate to use implicit differentiation.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}y^n = \\\\frac{d}{dx}x^m\\\\]<p>Since <strong>y</strong> is a function of <strong>x</strong>, remember to use the chain rule.</p>\\\\[ny^{n-1}\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = mx^{m-1}\\\\]<p>Now, solve for the derivative.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{mx^{m-1}}{ny^{n-1}}\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{m}{n}[x^{m-1}y^{-(n-1)}]\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{m}{n}x^{m-1}y^{-n+1}\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{m}{n}x^{m-1}(x^{\\\\frac{m}{n}})^{-n+1}\\\\]<p>Here we sub back in for what <strong>y</strong> is, as we need things in terms of x.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{m}{n}x^{m-1}x^{\\\\frac{m(-n+1)}{n}}\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{m}{n}x^{m-1+\\\\frac{m(-n+1)}{n}}\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{m}{n}x^{\\\\frac{mn-n}{n}}\\\\] \\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{m}{n}x^{\\\\frac{m-n}{n}}\\\\]<p>Wow! A lot of work there. Basically, if we let <strong>m / n = Q</strong>, a rational, then:</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = Qx^{Q-1}\\\\]<p>This is the same formula as we had before. This means we can extend our formula to the rationals.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}\\\\] \\\\[n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q}\\\\]<p>We can't yet extend this to all real numbers, as some numbers exist that aren't in the form <strong>m * n</strong>, with <strong>m</strong> and <strong>n</strong> being integers. These are the irrationals. To say our formula works for all reals, it must work for the irrationals as well. There's a trick to do this, however, in the form of a thought experiment.</p><p>Let's look at <strong>sqrt(2)</strong>, a famous irrational.<p><strong>sqrt(2) = 1.41421356</strong>\u2026</p></p><p>How \u201cclose\u201d is <strong>141/100</strong> to <strong>2</strong>? Just <strong>.0042\u2026</strong> away. What about <strong>141421356/100000000</strong> to <strong>2</strong>? <strong>2.373 * 10<sup>-9</sup></strong> away! Essentially, any rational (<strong>141/100</strong> or <strong>141421356/100000000</strong>) is arbitrarily close to any irrational in the set of real numbers. If we wanted, we could find rationals much closer to <strong>2</strong> than what we listed. Given this arbitrary nature, we can say that any rational is infinitesimally close to any irrational. Since this is the case, then our formula\u2014proven for the rationals\u2014should work just the same for the irrationals. With this idea, we can finally say that the power rule works for all real numbers!</p>\"]},\"derivative-ex-exponential-derivative-formula\":{\"title\":\"Proof of the Derivative of e^x and the Exponential Derivative Formula\",\"sections\":[\"<h1>Proof of the Derivative of e^x and the Exponential Derivative Formula</h1><i>Alexander De Carlo</i><p>Finding derivatives is usually a relatively simple task. Calculating them consists of rules, and as long as you follow them, you should be able to calculate a derivative. As we discover more of these rules, this leads us to wonder: how does one find the derivative of an exponential? This appears to be trickier than most rules, as exponentiation is not as related to other types of functions where derivative-rules are trivial.</p><p>We will begin by first attempting to find a general exponential derivative formula. By doing so, we hope to stumble on the famous derivative of <strong>e<sup>x</sup></strong>. If you've seen many of these proofs, you might be able to guess how this starts: the definition of a derivative.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{d x}\\\\left[a^x\\\\right]=\\\\lim _{h \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\left[\\\\frac{a^{x+h}-a^x}{h}\\\\right]\\\\]<p>Here, we can use exponent rules!</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{d x}\\\\left[a^x\\\\right]=\\\\lim _{h \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\left[\\\\frac{a^x\\\\left(a^h-a^x\\\\right)}{h}\\\\right]\\\\]<p>Now, notice that we can factor out <strong>a<sup>x</sup></strong> completely from the limit!</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{d x}\\\\left[a^x\\\\right]=a^x \\\\lim _{h \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\left[\\\\frac{a^h-1}{h}\\\\right]\\\\]<p>This may not look remarkable, but our procedure here is impactful. The derivative of an exponential function is itself an exponential function. But why is that special? The derivative of a polynomial is also a polynomial, is it not? But, look at this limit:</p>\\\\[\\\\lim _{h \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\left[\\\\frac{a^h-1}{h}\\\\right]\\\\]<p>There is no x-value here, which means this is some constant value. This means that the derivative of an exponential is actually the exact same exponential! Just changed by some constant. So, if we call that limit some constant <strong>c</strong>:</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{d x}\\\\left[a^x\\\\right]=c a^x\\\\]<p>Now, there are many, many ways to define <strong>e</strong>. Some define it in terms of an infinite series, and others define it in terms of banking interest. But for calculus, this is where we define it. Since we realized this fact, an obvious question may be what value of <strong>a</strong> leads to <strong>c</strong> being <strong>1</strong>? This is an interesting question because it means we can find a derivative of a function that returns the exact same function! Well, then that requires us to answer this question\u2026 </p><p>For what value of <strong>a</strong> does:</p>\\\\[\\\\lim _{h \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\left[\\\\frac{a^h-1}{h}\\\\right]=1?\\\\]<p>We have no clue how to solve that limit, but we do see that when we plug in random values of <strong>a</strong> and approximate, it spouts some random irrational number. When we approximate it for <strong>1</strong>, we get a number approaching <strong>2.718</strong>. In calculus, this is the fundamental constant that we call <strong>e</strong>. It is perhaps just as important as <strong>\ud835\udf0b</strong>.</p><p>So, now we can say that:</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{d x}\\\\left[e^{x}\\\\right]=e^{x}\\\\]<p>More generally:</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{d x}\\\\left[Ae^{x}\\\\right]=Ae^{x}\\\\]<p>So the family of functions of <strong>e<sup>x</sup></strong> all equal their derivative. Cool! Now, if this is the case, many can see its importance. To find the general exponential derivative formula, we can try to get our expression in the form <strong>e<sup>x</sup></strong>, as this will easily give us our derivative. This process seems tricky, though. We do know however that we must re-express <strong>a<sup>x</sup></strong>, so whatever we do must boil back down to that. Let's just start out with <strong>a<sup>x</sup></strong>. What's a way we can add <strong>e</strong> but not change our expression? Well, we know this identity:</p>\\\\[a^{\\\\log_a(C)} = C\\\\]<p>Let's use it.</p>\\\\[e^{\\\\ln(a^x)}\\\\]<p>A benefit of doing this is that via the property of logarithms, we can take out that <strong>x</strong>.</p>\\\\[e^{\\\\ln(a)x}\\\\]<p>Now, we can actually use the chain rule here and have <strong>ln(a)x</strong> as our substitute for <strong>u</strong>. The good thing is, the derivative of <strong>e<sup>u</sup></strong> is itself, making this process a lot easier.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}e^{\\\\ln(a)x} = e^{\\\\ln(a)x}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\ln(a)x\\\\]<p>Now this becomes trivial.</p>\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = e^{\\\\ln(a)x}\\\\ln(a)\\\\]\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = e^{\\\\ln(a^x)}\\\\ln(a)\\\\]\\\\[\\\\frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = a^x\\\\ln(a)\\\\]<p>And there we have it.
